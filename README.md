## 🚀 How It Works

👁️ The program cycles list of Twitch streams.
🟢 For each stream:
- Opens the stream in Chrome.
- Checks if the "Live" indicator is visible at the configured coordinates.
- Watches for the required time.

⚪ If the stream is offline, it:
- Tries another streamer with same skin.
- Or skip to next skin
